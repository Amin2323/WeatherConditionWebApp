# Network Architecture a Practical Approach

## Air Qaulity Measurement System

This Repository is belongs to the Air Qaulity Measurement System Project which contains all software artifacts. The documentation about the project progress and organization stuff is available in Wiki.  

## Overview 
--------------------------
Developing a monitoring system which is used for the evaluation of air pollution in the atmosphere of Kabul. The system provides its functionality by utilizing specified sensors. The results is be visualized on a monitoring system developed by the front end developers. Data acquired from the air will be sent to the system through sensors where it can be evaluated automatically by the system.
Major goals of this project are as follows: 

## GOAL
---------------------------
- It should be able to perform its function without reliable Internet connection
- Low cost devices such as OpenWrt Routers, Raspberry Pis, Arduinos and inexpensive sensors will be used to implement this project.
- It should provide automated and user friendly way to exchange air quality data between devices
- The system should be portable and battery powered.
